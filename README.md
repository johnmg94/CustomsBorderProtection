One hot encoding

Low Correlation Between Demographic & Border Crossings
If your engineered demographic feature has very low correlation with encounter_count, here are possible reasons and suggestions:

1. Check Data Quality
Are there missing values? → Fill missing values or drop them.
Is the feature properly encoded? → Ensure categorical encoding is meaningful.
Does the column have meaningful variance? → A constant or nearly uniform column won’t correlate well.
2. Try Different Feature Encoding
One-Hot Encoding: If demographic is categorical, try one-hot encoding instead of assigning arbitrary numbers.
Target Encoding: If demographic has meaningful order, consider mean encoding based on encounter_count.
3. Consider Non-Linear Relationships
Correlation only captures linear relationships.
Try a scatter plot (sns.scatterplot()) to check patterns.
Use models like decision trees or random forests, which handle non-linearity better.
4. Include Interaction Features
Try combining demographic with aor, citizenship, or encounter_type. Example:
python
Copy
Edit
df["demographic_x_encounter"] = df["demographic"] * df["encounter_type"]
Then check correlation again.
5. Check for Multicollinearity
If demographic is highly correlated with other variables, its independent correlation with encounter_count might be suppressed.

Use VIF (Variance Inflation Factor) to check:

python
Copy
Edit
from statsmodels.stats.outliers_influence import variance_inflation_factor

X = df[['demographic', 'encounter_type', 'citizenship']]  # Select features
vif_data = pd.DataFrame()
vif_data["Feature"] = X.columns
vif_data["VIF"] = [variance_inflation_factor(X.values, i) for i in range(X.shape[1])]
print(vif_data)

Next Steps
Plot relationships (seaborn.pairplot(), heatmap())
Test different encoding techniques
Check for multicollinearity
Use ML models instead of correlation for feature importance
